# Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization Playbook

## Project Overview
This is a capstone-level analytics project focused on building an end-to-end demand forecasting and inventory planning system for a retail business. The project is inspired by real-world inventory failures faced by large retailers and aims to demonstrate how better forecasting, bias monitoring, and inventory policy design can reduce both stockouts and excess inventory.

The objective is not just to forecast demand, but to convert forecasts into **actionable inventory decisions** and communicate those decisions clearly through dashboards and a planning playbook.

## Why this project
Retail inventory failures are rarely caused by a single issue. They usually happen due to a combination of demand uncertainty, delayed signals, static reorder policies, and lack of scenario planning. This project is designed to address those gaps by building a planning system that answers questions a real supply chain or operations team would ask.

This project is meant to reflect how analytics is used in practice, not as a one-off model, but as a repeatable decision-support system.

## What this project delivers
The project will deliver:
- A demand forecasting engine with multiple model comparisons
- Forecast accuracy and bias tracking
- Inventory policy recommendations (safety stock and reorder point)
- Scenario simulations for demand and lead-time shocks
- A Power BI dashboard for executives and planners
- A planner playbook explaining how to use the outputs for weekly decisions

---

## Success criteria
The project will be considered successful if:
- Forecast performance is evaluated using appropriate time-series metrics
- Inventory policies are clearly linked to service-level targets
- Trade-offs between service level, stockout risk, and inventory cost are explained
- Outputs are understandable to non-technical stakeholders
