# Case Study Anchor: Target Inventory Failure (2022)

In 2022, Target publicly reported significant inventory imbalances following a rapid shift in consumer demand. Categories that performed well during the pandemic experienced declining demand, while inventory levels remained high due to earlier purchasing decisions and long lead times.

As a result, Target faced:
- Excess inventory and aggressive markdowns
- Margin pressure
- Supplier renegotiations and operational adjustments

This situation highlights a common retail planning challenge: decisions are often made based on outdated demand assumptions, with limited mechanisms to detect forecast bias early or stress-test inventory policies under changing conditions.

## Why this case is relevant
The Target inventory issue was not caused by poor execution alone, but by planning decisions made under uncertainty. It illustrates the importance of:
- Monitoring forecast bias, not just accuracy
- Adjusting inventory policies dynamically
- Understanding how service-level targets affect inventory risk
- Stress-testing plans under alternative demand scenarios

This project uses the Target case as a real-world anchor to design a planning system that could help mitigate similar failures in large retail organizations.

## How this project relates to the case
While Target’s internal data is not public, the planning challenges are universal. This project recreates the same decision environment using public retail datasets and applies modern forecasting and inventory optimization techniques to demonstrate how analytics can support better planning outcomes.
